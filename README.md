# Anti-Tank Vehicle Simulation (Unity)

This is a 3D simulation of an anti-tank armored vehicle built in Unity. The simulation features a missile launcher system and enemy tanks that spawn randomly across the map. The core focus of the simulation is a **guided missile tracking system** triggered by player targeting input.
